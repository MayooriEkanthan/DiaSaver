        <h4>For Everyone</h4>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Whether you're already diagnosed,
          at risk, or simply want to stay healthy, taking preventive steps is essential to living a long and active life.
          Here's how you can take control.
        </p>

        <h4>For Diabetic Patients</h4>
        <p>
          If you are already diagnosed with diabetes, the goal is to manage your blood sugar levels and prevent complications.
          Stick to a diabetes-friendly meal plan filled with whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetables. Monitor your blood
          glucose regularly, follow your prescribed medications, and stay physically active with daily exercises like walking
          or light aerobics. Also, remember to care for your feet, manage stress effectively, and schedule regular health
          check-ups.
        </p>

        <h4>For People at Risk of Diabetes</h4>
        <p>
          If you have a family history of diabetes, are overweight, or have been diagnosed with prediabetes, you're at higher
          risk. Prevention starts with lifestyle changes. Losing even a small amount of weight, exercising regularly, and limiting
          sugar and refined carbs can significantly reduce your risk. Choose fiber-rich foods, quit smoking, drink more water,
          and ensure you're getting enough restful sleep. Don‚Äôt forget to check your blood sugar levels regularly.
        </p>

        <h4>For the General Population</h4>
        <p>
          Even if you're not currently at risk, healthy habits now can protect you in the future. Maintain a balanced diet,
          stay active, limit junk food, and keep a healthy weight. Avoid sitting for too long ‚Äî move every hour if possible ‚Äî
          and consider regular health screenings. Encouraging these habits in your children and family members builds a healthier
          future for everyone.
